- Project uses ES2015
- disable OS notifications with Elixir.config.notifications = false
- Replaced css-nano with clean-css - much faster.
- Dependencies are lazy loaded, to make start up time much faster.
- mix.scripts overhaul. Uses Webpack.
- mix.combine() is now your combiner + concatenater goto. Alias of mix.compress().
- gulp watch immediately triggers your test suite now.
- mix.rubySass(), deprecated in 2015, is now fully stripped. Use mix.sass() instead.
- Swapped Babel out for Buble. This is integrated into your mix.scripts() workflow, but you can use any loaders you want.

- Webpack
     - will read webpack.config.js, if in your project root.
